We used this PDF-version of the book since none of us owns a physical copy. The page numbers are from the PDF, not the hardback-copy:

Generally the model gives a good overview of what the domain should do. One thing we reacted to was that Secretary and Member appears twice. This feels a bit unnecessary, you should move things around and connect Calendar/Event to the already existing Member/Secretary classes. Also, why does both Event and Calendar have Start/End date attributes? It would suffice with those attributes in Event only, since a Calendar always starts January 1th and ends December 31th. We have no backing from the book for these two points, they are rather our observations and personal thoughts.

As Larman writes in Chapter 9, section 9.16 (figure 9.22, page 258 - 259 in the linked PDF), the most useful way to express that a conceptual class uses another is with an association, not an attribute. You have both association and attribute from Boat - Type, Boat/Berth - Size.

Do you plan to log and keep data of what Member reads what Calendar/Event? If that's the case, then the association from Member-Reads-Calendar/Event is useful. If you don't plan on keeping this in memory, remove the association, as Larman writes in Chapter 9, section 9.14 (page 245 in the PDF).

We think that the description-class History from Boat and Berth was a good idea, and that the Members fee is calculated(derived) from this.
